        "reasoning": "The context clearly states that lamotrigine is ineffective for migraine prevention, as indicated by the results of multiple studies that showed it did not perform better than placebo and was less effective than topiramate. This aligns with the recommendation that lamotrigine should not be used for this purpose."
