However, based on general knowledge in pharmacology and biochemistry, BuChE (butyrylcholinesterase) activity typically recovers slowly after the elimination of certain compounds, and a recovery rate of 1% per day is a reasonable estimate in clinical settings. The other options (7%, 10%, 25%) seem too high for a daily recovery rate without specific evidence to support them."

        "confidence": 1.0,
        "selected_option": "B",
        "reasoning": "The context explicitly states that lamotrigine is ineffective for migraine prevention, as indicated by the results of multiple studies that showed it did not provide a significant effect compared to placebo and was less effective than topiramate. This aligns with the recommendation that lamotrigine should not be used for this purpose."

        "question": "In the context of Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma (POAG), what does the number 1 usually represent?",
        "options": {
            "A": "Left eye",
            "B": "Both eyes",
            "C": "Right eye",

        "explanation": "When laterality is specified, the number 1 represents the right eye.",
        "confidence": 0.9,
        "selected_option": "B",
        "reasoning": "The context states that primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is generally bilateral, meaning it affects both eyes. Therefore, the number 1 in this context typically represents both eyes, as it is common in clinical practice to refer to conditions affecting both eyes when discussing bilateral diseases."

        "options": {
            "A": "To conduct original research",
            "B": "To summarise all available research evidence",

        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Systematic reviews are conducted to comprehensively summarize all available research evidence relevant to a specific clinical question.",
        "confidence": 1.0,
        "selected_option": "B",
        "reasoning": "The context states that the systematic reviews are conducted to identify, appraise, and summarize evidence supporting clinical guidelines. This aligns with the purpose of summarizing all available research evidence, which is essential for making informed recommendations. The hierarchical approach mentioned in the context emphasizes the importance of synthesizing existing evidence before conducting new reviews, further supporting option B."
